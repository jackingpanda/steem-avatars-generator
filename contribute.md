## How to contribute

We will soon create an entire guide to show you how we need the contributions in case you want to post them using utopian.io to get rewarded in STEEM.

In case you are not interested in STEEM (cryptocurrency) you can simply download a set of an avatar (body, eyes, hands, etc) to get them as base to create a new set. The body part must be exactly the same main shape, you can change color, add texture etc; you can change the expression of the eyes, add accesories to the hands, be creative!

Currently the one defitinitive base is the one for Plankton; you can find the entire set in the **img** folder.
